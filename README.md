My final project is a Python command-line grocery shopping interface, modeled after global online grocery apps. At its core is the "Product" class, which organizes and manages each grocery item’s name and price. The "main()" function serves as the user’s guide, enabling them to list items, add new ones, or finalize their shopping.

Key functions include "check_list" for generating a PDF of the shopping list, "add_list" for adding products, and "out_list" for creating a receipt with budget details. The program uses the "reportlab" library to produce these PDFs, making it easy to print or save lists and receipts.

Additional features include error handling, budget management, and support for multiple users, allowing shared shopping lists. This project simplifies the grocery shopping process through a user-friendly interface and practical features.
